Orbital mechanics simulation, or orrery, that I wrote in WebGL and Javascript. The main feature of jsOrrery is that the planets positions are accurate in regards to the date you set, and it has the consequence that you can observe things that happen in the real Solar System.


If you want to customize how jsOrrery behaves, you can pass a config object to its init method.

## Building the app

You can also use webpack to display the app in a local environment with `npm start`, which will then make the orrery available at http://localhost:2018. To build the js, you can run webpack directly in the terminal, for example `env NODE_ENV=production webpack`.
